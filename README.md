# PSTH_classifier
One of the basic physiological properties of neurons is their firing pattern, which can be represented in a peristimulus time histogram (PSTH). The shape of the PSTH is related with the morphology and functionality of the neuron within the neural network. This project aims to provide an automatic classification of PSTHs recorded in the auditory system.
